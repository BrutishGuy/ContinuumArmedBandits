# MAB and CMAB Resources

In this folder we put forward some reading materials and links to other practical works surrounding the topics of multi-armed bandits and contextual multi-armed bandits (or contextual bandits for short). This has been split up into two main sections, namely the first section Reading Materials and the second section Practical Resources. 

This set of materials was last updated August 2021. Please keep this list of materials as up-to-date as possible so long as product development on the Relevancy Calculator product is in an active state. There are always new and interesting pieces of work and research coming out which may be of interest to folks.

## Reading Materials

Below you can find links to various reading materials relating to bandits, the contextual variants, how to evaluate bandit algorithms, variations of bandits for continuous action domains, for ranking problems, etc.
